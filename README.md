# ARC

ARC is a web app still in early development that aims to help teams manage their work using an asset driven mindset.

## Core Concepts

The system is built under three concepts: Assets, Results, and Challenges. They are loosely based on OKR and Agile methodologies.

### Assets

Assets are things the teamwork wants to maximize and represent WHY the work should be done. They are an alternative to goals. The main difference is that while a goal is some sort of scope the team should achieve in a given date, assets are qualitative or quantitative metrics the team is always trying to maximize in balance. Assets are a way to collect feedback from the real world and adjust the team working logic.

### Results

Results represent WHAT work should be done. They are real deliverables or achievements that the team should reach. Results can stretch through a long period and need a clear declaration of done. They represent the high-level scope to be done.

### Challenges

Challenges are pieces of work carved out from results and represent HOW work should be done. They have clear assigments and completed in a short time frame. Challenges are periodically created and assigned to the team in small time cycles. They should not be spam for more than one month of planned time.

## Getting Started

The app is still in early stages and even an alfa version is probably months away. I work at it as a solo developer in my spare time after my main job working hours. When a version more suitable to experimenting and contributing is available i will update this file with instructions for installing, deploying and contributing.

## Built With

ARC is a Single Page Application developed with these main technologies

* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The world’s most popular front-end component library
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A comprehensive app development platform
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - JavaScript End to End Testing Framework
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - JavaScript module bundler

I also am helped by a lot of packages from the vibrating javascript community. All of them can be checked in the [package.json](package.json) file.

## Versioning

I try to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/joaomelo/arc/tags).
